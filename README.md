# transformation
 
This startpage is heavily inspired by this one: https://github.com/2Shrug/mystartpage

This startpage is made from scratch, but following 2Shrug's design.

# what is dynamic
The art showcase at the top of the page. Currently it is set album covers of bands I personally like. The program randomly chooses a band and then a random album from this band.

The highlighted 'boards'. These can really be any website, and the code can easily be changed to just randomly choose between a few sites. Currently, for each bulletpoint, a random board from 4chan or a subreddit is choosen. These are selected from a predefined list of the sites I like myself.

The quote at the bottom. Quotes by historical figures and philosophers I like. The program randomly chooses a person and then a random quote from this person.
